# RefreshGEDAction
A custom EPLAN Action defined in a "load" script

This Action refreshes the GED, for example after setting project properties, so that they become visible right away in the GED (otherwise one has to hit F5 to refresh).

Having this as a registered Action allows it to be called from anywhere.
